# Cloudinary Integration Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Cloudinary Integration Complete!

Your blog project has been successfully updated to use Cloudinary for image storage. This will solve the issue of images getting lost on Render after some time.

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Changed

### Backend Updates:
- âœ… Added Cloudinary dependencies (`cloudinary`, `multer-storage-cloudinary`, `axios`, `form-data`)
- âœ… Updated `uploadMiddleware.js` to support both local storage (development) and Cloudinary (production)
- âœ… Modified `blogController.js` to use the new image URL handling
- âœ… Updated routes to use the new upload middleware
- âœ… Enhanced health check endpoint to show Cloudinary status

### Frontend Updates:
- âœ… Updated `BlogCard.js` to handle both local and Cloudinary image URLs
- âœ… Updated `BlogDetail.js` to properly display Cloudinary images
- âœ… Images will now load from Cloudinary CDN for better performance

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Cloudinary Credentials

1. Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up for a free account
2. After signing up, go to your Dashboard
3. Note down these three values:
   - **Cloud Name** (from the top of the dashboard)
   - **API Key** (from Account Settings â†’ API Keys)
   - **API Secret** (from Account Settings â†’ API Keys)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

**Option A: Automatic Setup (Recommended)**
1. Run the setup script:
   ```batch
   setup_cloudinary.bat
   ```
2. Enter your Cloudinary credentials when prompted

**Option B: Manual Setup**
1. Open `backend/.env` file
2. Add these lines at the end:
   ```env
   # Cloudinary Configuration
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
   ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

The dependencies have already been added to `backend/package.json`. Just run:
```batch
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 4: Test the Setup

1. Start your backend server:
   ```batch
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Check the health endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
   - You should see: `{"status":"UP","cloudinary":true,"environment":"development"}`

3. Test image uploads in your admin panel

## ðŸŒŸ How It Works

### Development Mode:
- Images are stored locally in `backend/uploads/blog-images/`
- URLs will be like: `/uploads/blog-images/image-123456.jpg`

### Production Mode:
- Images are uploaded to Cloudinary
- URLs will be like: `https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/v123456/blog-images/image.jpg`
- Images are automatically optimized and served via CDN

3. **Production Test**: Deploy to Render and verify images persist

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?
